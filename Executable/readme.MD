# Downloading and running the program
* Double click the executable to run the program.
* Only works on Windows.
* To start the algorithm, set a number of times to iterate by clicking the iteration drop down menu, or type some desired number of iterations into the textbox. Click "step", and the algorithm will run. You can also click "run indefinitely". The default settings seem to always be finding a solution after a few iterations.
* There is no protection in place from running a massive population, or preventing the algorithm from running endlessly with stale phenotypes; that is, too few genes present in the gene pool.  If the program stops responding, close it.
* View a parent or child by clicking on them in the listbox.
