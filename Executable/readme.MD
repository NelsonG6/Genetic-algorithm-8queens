# Downloading and running the program
* Download all these files on a windows machine to run the program.
* To start the algorithm, set a number of times to iterate by clicking the iteration drop down menu, or type some desired number of iterations into the textbox. Click "step", and the algorithm will run. You can also click "run indefinitely". The default settings always find a solution. 
* There is no protection in place from running a large population, or preventing the algorithm from running endlessly with stale phenotypes, that is, too few genes present in the gene pool.  If the program stops responding, close it.
* View a parent or child by clicking on them in the listbox.
