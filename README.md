This is a graphical user interface to help see how genetic algorithms work. This was made for CS441: Artificial Intelligence, taken at PSU.

To run the algorithm, set a number of times to iterate by clicking the iteration drop down menu, or type some desired number of iterations into the textbox. Click "step", and the algorithm will run. There is no protection in place from running a large population, or preventing the algorithm from running endlessly with stale phenotypes, that is, too few genes present in the gene pool.  If the program stops responding, close it.

-View a parent or child by clicking on them in the listbox.
-Change settings each step of the algoritm.

ere's an example of how genetic algorithms work, from "rtificial Intelligence: A modern approach, third edition", by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. 

-Thanks, and feel free to send me feedback.
