* This is a graphical user interface to run a genetic algorithm for the purpose of sovling the 8-queens problem.
* The 8 queens problem is a puzzle where the objective is to take a chessboard that has 8 queens on it, and rearrange them in a way that has no mutually attacking pieces.
* The program is contained within the executable folder. It will only run on windows. The visual studio folder is for if you want to modify the source code yourself.
* Here's an example of how genetic algorithms work. A position of 8 queens on the chessboard is represented as 8 numbers, indicating that we restrict each queen to one column, and solve which row it should go on that column.
