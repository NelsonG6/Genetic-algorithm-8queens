* This is a graphical user interface to run a genetic algorithm for the purpose of sovling the 8-queens problem.
* The 8 queens problem is a puzzle where a chessboard configuration is to be found where 8 queens can be placed on an otherwise empty board, and none of them should attack one another.
* The program is contained within the executable folder. It will only run on windows. The visual studio folder is for if you want to modify the source code yourself.
* Here's an example of how genetic algorithms work, from *Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach, third edition*, by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig:
