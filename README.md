* This is a graphical user interface to help see how genetic algorithms work. This was made for CS441: Artificial Intelligence, taken at Portland State University.
* The program is contained within the executable folder. It will only run on windows. The visual studio folder is if you want to modify the source code yourself.
* To run the algorithm, set a number of times to iterate by clicking the iteration drop down menu, or type some desired number of iterations into the textbox. Click "step", and the algorithm will run. You can also click "run indefinitely". The default settings always find a solution. 
* There is no protection in place from running a large population, or preventing the algorithm from running endlessly with stale phenotypes, that is, too few genes present in the gene pool.  If the program stops responding, close it.
* View a parent or child by clicking on them in the listbox.
* Here's an example of how genetic algorithms work, from *Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach, third edition*, by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig:

* Thanks, and feel free to send me feedback.
